Simple web app to look up url and ip reputations on virus total

## Description

The frontend is a very simple php page that takes a list of URLs and/or IP addresses and sends them to a Go back end for processing. The output file is linked on the page and becomes available once the back end is finished. 

This was mostly cobbled together from other projects to make life a little easier. I don't recommend using it.

*Definitely do not host it publicly - very little thought was put into security or sanitizing inputs.*
